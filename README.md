# Anki-scripts

This repository is a collection of scripts I use to automate some tasks on Anki.

They sometimes directly touch the database, sometimes are filters on cards,
sometimes generate a list that can then be imported into Anki.

***Please read carefully the top of each script for a list of configuration
options and stuff you should modify before running them. These scripts can break
your database!***
