# Anki-scripts

This repository is a collection of scripts I use to automate some tasks on Anki.

They sometimes directly touch the database, sometimes are filters on cards,
sometimes generate a list that can then be imported into Anki.

***Please read carefully the top of each script for a list of configuration
options and stuff you should modify before running them. These scripts can break
your database!***

The scripts assume some knowledge of python for configuration. If you don't know
Python and/or can't explain what the script does and how it works, please don't
try to use it, it can break your database!

See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for more legal details on what you can or
cannot do with these scripts. Basically, you are allowed to use the scripts as
you please, but not to complain in case you break anything in doing so. Please
note this is not legal advice and only consider the text of [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
for assessing the rights you are provided.
